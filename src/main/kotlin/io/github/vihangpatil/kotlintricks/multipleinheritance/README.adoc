= Multiple Inheritance (effect) in Kotlin

Languages like Ruby had supported "multiple-inheritance" like behavior using Mixin. +
Same can be done in Java, but it leads to a very verbose code. Check the code at the end of file. +
But, in Kotlin same can be achieved by compact code using Kotlin's delegate feature. +
